            <h3>Behind the Dough</h3>
            <p>
                Here's the scoop from Doughp's founder on how this flavor came to be: 
                "I first made Red Velvet on a total whim, just a few months into business in 2017. One day, while mixing up Doughp at our original commercial kitchen in Oakland, I left to grab some lunch at a nearby bakery."
            </p>
            <p>
                "I saw an absolutely delicious-looking red velvet cake in their dessert case and immediately thought: I NEED to know what this tastes like in cookie dough! I bought the cake and mixed it right into a small 5lb batch of Doughp; cream cheese frosting, cake, and all! HEAVEN by the spoonful!"
